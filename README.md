### 1. Building Trust in Spectrum Sharing: A Decentralized Architecture for Spectrum Databases


**Book chapter:** Building Trust in Spectrum Sharing: A Decentralized Architecture for Spectrum Databases. Springer Nature

**Abstract:** :The emergence of novel networks, namely Sixth Generation (6G) technologies, promises advanced connectivity, high data rates, and improved reliability. However, such networks must use large portions of the electromagnetic spectrum to deliver the promised services. Moreover, in the telecommunication context, the electromagnetic spectrum is considered a limited resource; its scarcity demands strategies and (quasi-)optimal allocation collectively guided by regulatory, technical, and market domains. Existing spectrum management solutions, such as spectrum databases, face data volume, velocity, variety, quality, privacy, and trust challenges. To overcome these challenges and consequently make spectrum databases prone to real-world scenarios, herein it is proposed a novel architecture integrating geolocation data, propagation models, Web services, and decentralized spectrum data processing (Blockchain). This chapter presents an architecture for a decentralized spectrum database that can be leveraged to facilitate the rapid development of economic and social activities through broadband wireless services provision. It is also described a Brazilian test case, the unused digital Television (TV) spectrum (TVWS), to validate and test the proposed architecture to create novel digital inclusion mechanisms.

### 3. PRISM-Guardian: Enhancing Data Privacy in Devices With Sound Collection, Recognition, and Sharing Through Blockchain Technology

**Journal**: IEEE Sensors Letters

**Abstract**: The proliferation of voice-activated devices, such as virtual assistants and voice-controlled systems, has changed how people interact with technology and the environment. These devices collect data that can be sent to servers to process sound, returning responses or suggestions to the user. However, the widespread use of these devices has led to intensive data collection, exposing sensitive information, such as conversations and intimate audio. In this context, we developed PRISM-guardian, a technique for sharing and tracking sound data without revealing its origin, thus preserving privacy. Transparently, audio generators, such as residential users, can track who accessed their information and why. We collected 1000 audio samples, each lasting 10 s, to recognize short-duration cough and sneeze sounds. We achieved average sound recognition processing times of 3.78 s, 6.78 ms to encapsulate the data in the API, and an average of 48 ms to save the data on the blockchain. Besides, we present a mathematical formalization of PRISM and conduct tests to identify the origin of the sound. The results showed that the identity of the sound source is preserved while this source can view and track the data.

### 5 ELICITATION: A Satellite Constellation Simulator Using Multi-Agent Systems, Blockchain and the IoMT

**International Conference** EEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC) 2024

**Abstract**: With the continuous increase in the number of satellites orbiting Earth, the efficient and coordinated management of these assets becomes a critical concern. This paper introduces the innovative project Elicitation, a simulator for satellite constellations based on Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Blockchain, and the Internet of Mobile Things (IoMT). The current scenario highlights growing challenges in the supervision and coordination of satellites, emphasizing the need for automated solutions. Elicitation addresses this complexity by integrating MAS to simulate dynamic interactions between satellites in Earth climate monitoring tasks, taking advantage of blockchain technology to guarantee the security, transparency and integrity of the data generated. One notable aspect that contributes to Elicitation’s appeal is its ability to take advantage of authentic satellite positioning data and real information relating to natural events. Consequently, the system operates autonomously to identify the ideal satellite capable of capturing data related to natural events at any given time. The average decision time per agent was 0.19 seconds for a collective set of 11 agents, corresponding to 11 satellites in a 120-day dataset with 43 target events.
