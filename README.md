### 1. Building Trust in Spectrum Sharing: A Decentralized Architecture for Spectrum Databases


**Book chapter:** Building Trust in Spectrum Sharing: A Decentralized Architecture for Spectrum Databases. Springer Nature

**Abstract:** :The emergence of novel networks, namely Sixth Generation (6G) technologies, promises advanced connectivity, high data rates, and improved reliability. However, such networks must use large portions of the electromagnetic spectrum to deliver the promised services. Moreover, in the telecommunication context, the electromagnetic spectrum is considered a limited resource; its scarcity demands strategies and (quasi-)optimal allocation collectively guided by regulatory, technical, and market domains. Existing spectrum management solutions, such as spectrum databases, face data volume, velocity, variety, quality, privacy, and trust challenges. To overcome these challenges and consequently make spectrum databases prone to real-world scenarios, herein it is proposed a novel architecture integrating geolocation data, propagation models, Web services, and decentralized spectrum data processing (Blockchain). This chapter presents an architecture for a decentralized spectrum database that can be leveraged to facilitate the rapid development of economic and social activities through broadband wireless services provision. It is also described a Brazilian test case, the unused digital Television (TV) spectrum (TVWS), to validate and test the proposed architecture to create novel digital inclusion mechanisms.

### 3. PRISM-Guardian: Enhancing Data Privacy in Devices With Sound Collection, Recognition, and Sharing Through Blockchain Technology

**Journal**: IEEE Sensors Letters

**Abstract**: The proliferation of voice-activated devices, such as virtual assistants and voice-controlled systems, has changed how people interact with technology and the environment. These devices collect data that can be sent to servers to process sound, returning responses or suggestions to the user. However, the widespread use of these devices has led to intensive data collection, exposing sensitive information, such as conversations and intimate audio. In this context, we developed PRISM-guardian, a technique for sharing and tracking sound data without revealing its origin, thus preserving privacy. Transparently, audio generators, such as residential users, can track who accessed their information and why. We collected 1000 audio samples, each lasting 10 s, to recognize short-duration cough and sneeze sounds. We achieved average sound recognition processing times of 3.78 s, 6.78 ms to encapsulate the data in the API, and an average of 48 ms to save the data on the blockchain. Besides, we present a mathematical formalization of PRISM and conduct tests to identify the origin of the sound. The results showed that the identity of the sound source is preserved while this source can view and track the data.

### 5. ELICITATION: A Satellite Constellation Simulator Using Multi-Agent Systems, Blockchain and the IoMT

**International Conference** EEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC) 2024

**Abstract**: With the continuous increase in the number of satellites orbiting Earth, the efficient and coordinated management of these assets becomes a critical concern. This paper introduces the innovative project Elicitation, a simulator for satellite constellations based on Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Blockchain, and the Internet of Mobile Things (IoMT). The current scenario highlights growing challenges in the supervision and coordination of satellites, emphasizing the need for automated solutions. Elicitation addresses this complexity by integrating MAS to simulate dynamic interactions between satellites in Earth climate monitoring tasks, taking advantage of blockchain technology to guarantee the security, transparency and integrity of the data generated. One notable aspect that contributes to Elicitation’s appeal is its ability to take advantage of authentic satellite positioning data and real information relating to natural events. Consequently, the system operates autonomously to identify the ideal satellite capable of capturing data related to natural events at any given time. The average decision time per agent was 0.19 seconds for a collective set of 11 agents, corresponding to 11 satellites in a 120-day dataset with 43 target events.

### 6. NASCERR: Nanosatellite with Electronics Radiation Robust

**International Conference**: International Conference on Global Aeronautical Engineering and Satellite Technology (GAST) 2024

**Abstract**: Faced with increasing access to and demand for space products space products, educational/research institutions and private companies need space devices that are robust and tolerant of faults and space adversities, such as radiation. The NASCERR mission aims to homologate a new version of an onboard computer for CubeSat missions with a strong emphasis on fault tolerance, the ROBC. In addition to redundancy in the power supply and voltage control system, the system also has error correction codes to protect the data in memory, thus offering greater reliability of the data stored by the sensors and stored by the sensors and sent to Earth. The ROBC passed the thermal tests and the error-correcting codes for memory protection were applied to protect the SRAM, bringing greater reliability to the data stored by the sensors. The NASCERR project is is a partnership between universities and the private sector, financed by the Brazilian government

### 8. Blockchain Applied In Decentralization of Ground Stations To Educational Nanosatellites

**International Conference**: IEEE 24th Latin American Test Symposium (LATS) 2023

**Abstract**: Space has increasingly attracted the attention of governments, large industries, and universities. One of the most popular strategies in recent years has been the adoption of nanosatellites to fulfill different missions, which can work alone or in constellations. Universities stand out among the agents launching nanosatellites, with more than 600 launches until 2022. Given the growth of entities that control space missions, it is necessary to implement new methods for communication between control and satellite to accelerate data transmission and provide a high-security degree. Our work proposes a consortium archi-tecture between Ground Stations (GSs) so that a GS as a Service (GSaaS) works with low cost, reliability, and resource sharing. We simulated a nanosatellite mission in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) with MATLAB to obtain the parameters of average communication time, propagation loss, and at which angles the communication would be most affected by atmospheric phenomena. Then, we implement business rules for communication between GS and satellites using smart contract concepts. We set up a blockchain to provide the decentralization infrastructure and created a web service to provide a communication API between nanosatellite and blockchain.
